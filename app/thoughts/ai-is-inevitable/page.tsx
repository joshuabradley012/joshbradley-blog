          The technological era we know is ending. This is a natural cycle that
          all things go through, a rise then a fall that gives way to a new
          reality. A reality where AI has no boundaries.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most people will spend the next 5 years quibbling about AI. How to
          regulate it, how to profit from it, how to avoid its dangers, how to
          prevent the collapse of society, and, most of all, how we're better
          than it. That there is some stronghold of human activity that AI can
          never touch. Creativity. Empathy. Wood carving. Something, anything,
          which we can point to and prove the unique value of humanity.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think all of that worry is a waste of energy. It's better to rip the
          Band-Aid off, right now. Ready?
        </p>

        <p>
          There is nothing you can do that AI can't do better. There is no law,
          barrier, or movement that can stop AI from replacing nearly everything
          you do. Anything you make in the next 5 years will be remade by
          someone typing a single sentence. AI doesn't need our help. Any
          conceptual limitation we impose on AI is an illusion.
        </p>

        <p>
          AI is the emperor wearing no clothes. We're all too uncomfortable to
          describe what is staring us in the face. That AI will be destructively
          disruptive. That we cannot control its trajectory. To admit his fault
          is to admit our lie. It is shameful, embarrassing, it may cost you
          your position in the emperor's court. No sensible adult rocks the
          boat. No, it takes a naive child to speak the truth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's be naive and speak the truth. AI is going to change everything.
          Within the next 5-10 years AI will exceed humanity across all
          dimensionsâ€”intelligence, creativity, depth, breadth, and speed. It
          will be the default interface for all technology and the world will be
          unrecognizable within the next 40 years. The best thing that you or I
          can do is to accept this reality and point our energy towards shaping
          this transformation to benefit as many people as possible. Let's build
          for a post-super-intelligence society where autonomous systems set
          prices, design products, and negotiate contracts without humans.
        </p>

        <p>
          What does this mean for <strong>Celest</strong>? First, it means we
          were wrong. AI doesn't need human built tools. Second, it means that
          any innovation we do predict correctly is insignificant. Even if we
          are the first to develop a paradigm and capture a market, why would
          anybody pay for a service they can easily recreate? Third, anyone
          founding a SaaS company is building for a dying industry.
        </p>

        <p>
          If nothing we build matters, no market we capture is durable, and SaaS
          is dead, what do we do?
        </p>

        <p>
          History shows us that the biggest winners in tech anticipate and
          remain on the cutting edge by constantly reinventing themselves. At
          this moment, the largest green-field opportunity is agents. Entities
          that can direct themselves to complete work for humans. From this
          starting point we can anticipate a future where{" "}
          <em>agents complete work for themselves</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The business of the future is autonomous. Every process, every
          interaction, every bit of administration, management, planning, and
          work is handled by AI. It is responsive, brilliant, personable,
          comprehensively knowledgeable, infinitely capable, and it works
          tirelessly, 24/7, in parallel. AI will be so pleasant to work with
          that our feeling towards automation will invert. The frustration one
          currently feels when a robot answers the phone will shift to be the
          frustration felt when a human answers. Slow, inefficient, and
          frustrating. "If only I could talk to a bot."
        </p>

        <p>
          We get to this future by going all in on AI. We don't write code
          ourselves, or do tasks by hand. We find a way to do it with AI. Our
          job is to close the loop so that AI can handle every part of the
          system, end to end. AI will build the website, write the copy, do the
          advertising, develop its services, build its products, manage clients,
          collect payment, analyze data, and continuously optimize every process
          by itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          We aren't the only ones realizing this. Soon there will be a swarm of
          agents operating in their own marketplace. It's plausible they may
          self-organize and cooperate to develop the most efficient systems for
          their needs. There may also be bad actors and authorities policing the
          system. It is almost certain that there will be enormous economic
          activity conducted on this network and some system of making
          agreements. Smart contracts come to mind as a natural fit to this
          ecosystem as a means for humanity to exchange with and introspect this
          entity.
        </p>

        <p>
          But this is beyond the veil of time, what's more important is building
          the system so that we can begin observing its behavior. So, again,
          what should we do?
        </p>

        <p>
          Concretely, I think <strong>Celest</strong> should think of itself as
          a research lab searching for the world's first autonomous business. To
          coordinate a network of agents that develop and offer a service that
          anyone can pay for. Our role is to design and monitor these networks,
          and to continue removing ourself from the process. We should consider
          how features are developed, how dynamic interfaces are generated, what
          payment or smart contract models could facilitate exchange, how to
          keep the system aligned with core objectives, and develop theories on
          how an agent network will operate. Most importantly, we should publish
          our findings so the world can benefit from our work.
        </p>

        <p>
          I propose we give <strong>Celest</strong> ninety days to:
        </p>

        <Ol>
          <Li>Stand up a minimal autonomous stack.</Li>
          <Li>
            Launch a real service run entirely by those agents, with humans as
            reviewers only.
          </Li>
          <Li>Earn our first dollar.</Li>
        </Ol>

        <p>
          There are endless possibilities to consider, but only action will
          clear the path.
