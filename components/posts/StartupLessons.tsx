      <p>
        I am learning hard lessons while building Celest, an AI-driven software
        for content creation. My goal is to create an interface that AI can use
        alongside a user. It is pushing the limits of my ability and has helped
        me grow as an engineer and as a person. This is what I have learned.
      </p>
      <H2>Projects are always 80% complete</H2>
      <p>
        The finish line always feels close, but it never comes. You are creating
        something that will evolve and grow. No matter how many deadlines you
        set, hit, or miss, the work remains constant.
      </p>

      <H2>The last 10% takes 90% of your effort</H2>
      <p>
        The closer you get to finishing, the harder it becomes. The beginning of
        a project feels great because there is no resistance. As the project
        grows, everything must be built with consideration to everything else,
        and the friction compounds. The edge of a problem is sparse and wide and
        takes effort to traverse.
      </p>

      <H2>Composition is powerful</H2>
      <p>
        I've stopped chasing perfect abstractions. Now I create flexible,
        reusable blocks of code then compose those blocks into unique patterns.
        I relate this process to creating music. 12 simple notes can combine
        into nearly infinite arrangements of chords and melodies. Their beauty
        lies in their simplicity and harmony. Good code is simple enough to
        create many, powerful combinations. It thrives in expressing complexity.
      </p>

      <H2>Don't reinvent the wheel</H2>
      <p>
        Many common challenges have been solved. If you need something to roll,
        and a wheel exists, just use it. Don't waste your talents, go build
        something new.
      </p>

      <H2>Always improve the factory</H2>
      <p>
        Construct a factory that produces high quality products which are
        modular, extensible, and easy to upgrade. Actively keep the factory
        clean, organized, and up to date. This is the type of work that
        compounds. It can be reused across all projects, refined as a whole, and
        give you an edge over your competitors.
      </p>

      <H2>Be a perfectionist</H2>
      <p>
        Focus on your core product offering, and perfect it. Your first
        impression creates the quality of your brand. It has to be
        unforgettable. Stay focused on the single - aha moment - that you need
        to create.
      </p>

      <H2>Doing is knowing</H2>
      <p>
        Conceptual understanding is no replacement for practical experience.
        Knowledge only exists in your mind until you experience it, then it
        becomes embedded in your mind as a skill. It humbles your tongue and
        sharpens your perception about what you can and cannot do.
      </p>

      <H2>Do until it's done</H2>
      <p>
        There is a lot that goes into creating a production grade application.
        There is no shortcut to doing it well, it may take years. Ensure your
        circumstance and lifestyle supports this effort.
      </p>

      <H2>Do it your way</H2>
      <p>
        Surrender to your way of being and find your optimal flow. Everyone
        works differently and no book can teach you how to be you. The greatest
        things are created by people relentlessly pursuing their interests. Your
        path is guaranteed to be unique. The important part is getting started.
        Start building, start learning, and start improving all areas of your
        life. The goal is to live a good life, building a great business is just
        a part of that.
